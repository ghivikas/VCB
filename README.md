This Node.js app demonstrates the Watson Assistant service in a simple chat interface simulating a cognitive virtual Banker.

In this app we will be using angular, javacript and watson assistence services.

In this chat app customer will be intractin with virtual banker which will be behaving like real banker.
we have used angular and javascript in chat application and connecting with Watson assistant to via Rest services.
then this app will invoke all intents, entity and dialog.

we are handling payload and conversation in runtime and adding div elements on runtime so that it will always aligned when chat grows over time.

Its just prototype we can make this more realistic. Putting more conversation data in watson and put an authentication URL to authenticate and authorize  customer via OTP and give Customer a totally different experience.
